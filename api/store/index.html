<p><code>tempo-store</code> contains utilities to wrap a value into a <code>Store</code> instance and track its lifecycle.</p>
<h2 id="property">Property</h2>
<p>A <code>Property</code> instance wraps a single generic value of type <code>T</code>. It exposes a field <code>observable</code> where you can add your own listeners. These will be triggered any time <code>Property.set</code> is invoked but only if the value differs from its previous state. To control such behavior it is possible to pass a function <code>equal</code>. The default implementation performs a structural equality test.</p>
<h2 id="store">Store</h2>
<p>A <code>Store</code> instance wraps a property and adds a <code>reducer</code> function to the mix. With the <code>reducer</code> it is possible to influence the value of store by invoking <code>process(action: Action)</code>. Whenver that method is called, <code>reducer(currentState: State, action: Action): State</code> is invoked and the value of store is accordinlgy updated. It is possible to monitor state changes and action triggers by adding listeners to the <code>observable</code> field. Note that these listeners should have the shape <code>(state: State, action: Action, changed: boolean) =&gt; void</code>.</p>
